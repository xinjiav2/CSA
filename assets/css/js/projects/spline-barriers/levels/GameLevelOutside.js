Sometimes the walls themselves can give you hints, like cracks or moss. Take your time and don't rush through it. If you get lost, try retracing your steps and look for patterns in the layout. You can do it!"

Also, remember that the castle has a rich history, and learning about it might provide insights into how to navigate its challenges. Stay curious and keep exploring!"
